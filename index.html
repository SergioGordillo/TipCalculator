    <!-- John and his family went on holidays and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were 124€, 48€ and 268€. To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). 
    
    He likes to tip the 20% of the amount when the bill is less than 50€, 15% when the bill is between 50 and 200€ and 10% if the bill is more than 200€. 

    In the end, John would like to have two arrays. 

    1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill).
    2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip)

NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply if with 20/100=0.2-->
